# React Native ùû™ (10 points total + 2 points extra credit)

This assignment is meant to introduce you to React Native, Expo, and the basics of using RESTful APIs. Specifically, you will be building essential screens for a fitness tracking application. We recommend starting this assignment as soon as possible, and not waiting until the deadline! See the videos in the assignment description for helpful information on setting up your project as well as what an example walkthrough may look like.

### Submission Details
**Important:** DO NOT use web browser simulation of Expo when testing your app for submission; it is unable to detect potential errors that may arise when your app is actually run on a mobile device. You will end up losing a significant number of points if some features do not work properly on an emulator/physical device.

When your assignment is ready for grading, please submit the following:
1. Your tested operating system (either Android or iOS), repository name, and latest commit hash from GitHub Classroom. e.g. `android, react-native-s22-alpha-osori, 81d0462`.
2. Your demo video as a file attachment or as a publicly accessible link to the video. Regarding what your demo should include, refer to the [example walkthrough](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/295709/assignments/1528164#example-walkthrough) section of the assignment.
